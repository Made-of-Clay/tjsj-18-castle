# Challenge 13: Castle

Uses [Three.js + Vite + TypeScript starter](https://github.com/pachoclo/vite-threejs-ts-template) to start.

Currently using [Modular Fort 01](https://polyhaven.com/a/modular_fort_01) from [Rico Cilliers](https://polyhaven.com/all?a=Rico%20Cilliers).

WIP Just getting the castle assembled. Not sure where it'll go from there.
